### Localization Metadata Register (LMR)

The Localization Metadata Register is an addressable register that contains metadata of
all the pseudonyms that it is responsible for. There are multiple metadata registers divided over
the health landscape. In the end, all health data should have corresponding metadata available on one of the available
metadata registers. The Metadata Register endpoints should be described in the Addressing Register.
The LMR should contain entries for all the metadata in the Metadata Register.

At this moment, the LMR only supports [FHIR ImaginStudy](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/imagingstudy.html)
as part of a PoC. Further resources will be added to the application in consultation
with other parties in the field

purposes** to illustrate potential system communication patterns and architectures.

This codebase:

- Is NOT intended for production use
- Does NOT represent a final specification
- Should NOT be considered feature-complete or secure
- May contain errors, omissions, or oversimplified implementations
- Has NOT been tested or hardened for real-world scenarios

The code examples are *only* meant to help understand concepts and demonstrate possibilities.

## Usage

The application is a FastAPI application, so you can use the FastAPI documentation to see how to use the application.

## Development

You can either run the application natively or in a docker container. If you want to run the application natively you
can take a look at the initialisation steps in `docker/init.sh`.

The preferred way to run the application is through docker.

If you run Linux, make sure you export your user ID and group ID to synchronize permissions with the Docker user.

```
export NEW_UID=$(id -u)
export NEW_GID=$(id -g)
```

After this you can simply run `docker compose up`.

The application will be available at <https://localhost:8503> when the startup is completed.
