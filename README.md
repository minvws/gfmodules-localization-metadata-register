### Localization Metadata Register (LMR)

The Localization Metadata Register is an addressable register that contains metadata of
all the pseudonyms that it is responsible for. There are multiple metadata registers divided over
the health landscape. In the end, all health data should have corresponding metadata available on one of the available
metadata registers. The Metadata Register endpoints should be described in the Addressing Register.
The LMR should contain entries for all the metadata in the Metadata Register.

## First run

If you need to run the application without actual development, you can use the autopilot functionality. When this
repository is checked out, just run the following command:

```bash
make autopilot
```

This will configure the whole system for you and you should be able to use the API right away at http://localhost:8503/docs


## Usage

The application is a FastAPI application, so you can use the FastAPI documentation to see how to use the application.

## Development

Build and run the application

Firstly, copy the `app.conf.example` to `app.conf` and adjust values when needed.
If you run Linux, make sure you export your user ID and group ID to synchronize permissions with the Docker user.

export NEW_UID=$(id -u)
export NEW_GID=$(id -g)

When you're ready, build the application with: make container-build.

Run make up to start the application.
